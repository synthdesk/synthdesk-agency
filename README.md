## synthdesk-agency

synthdesk-agency transforms listener records into human-
and machine-readable epistemic snapshots.
it does not recommend, route, optimize, or act.

### what it does
- aggregates and annotates listener artifacts
- produces descriptive summaries and snapshots
- exposes structured, non-actionable outputs

### what it does not do
- generate advice or instructions
- rank opportunities or assets
- imply timing, magnitude, or preference
- interact with exchanges or capital

agency outputs are descriptive only.
machine-readable does not imply executable.
